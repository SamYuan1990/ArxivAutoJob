2201.11903,2022-01-28,Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning \\ in Large Language Models,prompt,"The paper focuses on chain-of-thought prompting, which is a prompting technique that enhances reasoning in large language models without requiring training or fine-tuning. It falls under the 'prompt' category as it involves improving single-agent reasoning through prompt engineering rather than multi-agent systems, external data management, or model training.",hard code style,"Chain-of-thought prompting requires manually crafting prompts with exemplars that include intermediate reasoning steps. This is a hard-coded approach where humans design the prompting structure and provide specific reasoning demonstrations, rather than automated adjustment mechanisms or code implementations.",True
